                <p>Thrissur is a location which is famous for the grand temple festivities and the poorams which are celebrated with great fervor. The prime attraction of this location is the Vadakkunnathan Temple, constructed for Lord Shiva. Situated right
                    in the midst of the city, this divine structure emanates vibrant positive energy and has got a breathtakingly marvelous architecture. Constructed in the famed Kerala style of architecture, this temple houses the Shiva lingam which
                    is said to have appeared under a banyan tree due to the will of Lord Shiva. The lingam was then transferred into the temple from that Mula Sthana. Lord Parasurama is said to be the reason for Lord Shiva to manifest in this region.

                    Another must-visit place in Thrissur is Basilica of Our Lady of Dolours, an impressive Indo-Gothic church that is considered to be the largest in the country. Constructed in 1814, the church is a testimony to the city’s diverse culture and is worth your
                    time for the brilliant white façade which makes it so identifiable, the imposing interiors with a large nave and 11 altars, and the stunning murals depicting scenes from the Christian scriptures. The Dolours Basilica is nestled amid
                    verdant parklands and spreads over an area of 25,000 sq. ft. approx. It is one of the most memorable places to visit in Thrissur, so don’t miss to include it in your itinerary.
