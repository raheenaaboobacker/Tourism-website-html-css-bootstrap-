                    railway station in Kochi city, the 2nd busiest in Thiruvananthapuram railway division and the 5th busiest in Southern Railways. Initially, Ernakulam was the headquarters of the Ernakulam District but was later shifted to Kakkanad,

                    Set foot into Fort Kochi and you will be instantly transported to a different time period. This place is steeped in the history and culture of all who have occupied it through the ages. Its roots and essence are unique in its diversity. While walking
                    through K. J. Herschel Road, one gets a glimpse of Fort Immanuel. This former Portuguese bastion, built in 1503, is a sign of the strategic alliance between the Maharaja of Cochin and the Portuguese Monarch. Further along the road
                    one can see the Dutch Cemetery, housing the graves of former Colonists. People also love visiting the nearby Thakur House, a bungalow built in typical colonial era style. It now belongs to Thakur and Co., a renowned tea trading firm,
                    but was once the residence of the officers of the National Bank of India during British rule. It was formerly called Kunal or Hill Bungalow.

                    The Mattancherry Palace, also known as Dutch Palace, is one of the finest examples of the Kerala style of architecture interspersed with colonial influences. Located at around 12 km from Ernakulam, it was built around 1545 C.E. by the Portuguese as a
                    present to King Veera Kerala Verma of Kochi dynasty. It came to be known as the Dutch Palace as it underwent major repairs at the hands of the Dutch. It is famous for its long and spacious halls along with its central courtyard. It
                    is also the home of the deity of the royal family, Pazhayannur Bhagavathy (the Deity of Pazhayannur). This double storied palace has a lovely collection of murals. These depict some of the great Indian epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata
                    along with revered Gods of the Hindu faith like Lord Krishna of Guruvayur Temple.
