                    Several decades ago, back in the 70s, a serene beach in Thiruvananthapuram shot to fame. It became a stopover in the hippie trail from Goa to Sri Lanka and has never been the same. Over the years the beach became more of an emotion and firmly placed itself
                    on the global tourism map. With its palm-fronted beaches, shimmering sands and a blend of unique cultural and adventurous experiences, it is one of the much-loved beaches in Kerala. This is Kovalam. Life begins with a surreal vibrance
                    at Kovalam. Whether you choose to laze away with your favourite drink and stare into the horizon amid fishing activities, to scuttle through the alleyways experiencing the myriad cultures or get adventurous by indulging in some sporty
                    activities.
